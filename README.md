## Features

- **Dynamic Text**: Randomly selected paragraphs from a pre-defined set for each game.
- **Real-Time Feedback**: Track your Words Per Minute (WPM), Characters Per Minute (CPM), and mistakes as you type.
- **Blinking Cursor**: Visual indicator with a blinking cursor effect for better focus.
- **Reset Functionality**: Restart the game anytime to improve your performance or practice a new paragraph.

## How to Use

2. **Type the Paragraph**: Begin typing the text shown in the provided input field.
3. **Track Your Progress**: Observe your WPM, CPM, mistakes, and time remaining in the game.
4. **Reset**: Click the "Reset" button to start a new game.

## Customization
## Add New Paragraphs
You can easily add new paragraphs to the app by modifying the paragraphs array in the JavaScript section:


const paragraphs = [
    "Your new paragraph here...",
    "Another motivational message...",
    ...
];

# Adjust Time Limit
To change the time limit, update the maxTime variable in the JavaScript:

let maxTime = 120;  // Time in seconds

## Future Enhancements
# Leaderboard: Implement a leaderboard feature to compare typing scores with other users.
# Mobile Responsiveness: Improve the UI for better compatibility with mobile devices.
